# map-data-workshop

This workshop will provide an overview of the current state of mapping technologies, teach the basics of data collection, management, and dissemination including building databases, APIs, and applications, and through this process, the attendees will also learn about the legal hurdles that have be overcome to access and reuse data, and the steps they can take to minimize or eliminate such hurdles.

## Duration

The full workshop will last three days, with the structure as shown below:

### Day 1

**09:00 AM-09:30 AM:** Intro and goals<sup>1</sup>
**09:30 AM-10:30 AM:** Overview of the web mapping workflow and stack<sup>2</sup>
**10:30 AM-11:00 AM:** break  
**11:00 AM-12:30 PM:** Overview of the technologies of the stack<sup>3</sup>
**12:30 PM-02:00 PM:** lunch
**02:00 PM-03:30 PM:** Demonstration/dissection of mapping apps<sup>4</sup>
**03:30 PM-04:00 PM:** break  
**04:00 PM-05:30 PM:** Computer preparation, installation of software<sup>5</sup>

<sup>1</sup> - Who we are and what we want to achieve
<sup>2</sup> - How to go from data to a sharable URL
<sup>3</sup> - Introduce the variety of technologies that can be used in each piece of the stack (jQuery vs. an MVC, different backends and why you might use each)
<sup>4</sup> - Demonstrate mapping apps, and also introduce Chrome dev tools for dissecting and debugging. After a couple of examples, point the class to the URL of a mapping app and have them figure out which technology it uses and how it is assembled.
<sup>5</sup> - Nodejs, PostGIS, git, Github, environment, setting up a repository

## Prerequisites

This is a hands-on workshop to learn how to create map-based data analysis and visualization applications. JavaScript knowledge is required, and server-side JavaScript knowledge is preferred, as most of the coding will be server-side using `nodejs`.

Every participant should have a laptop with `nodejs` and a preferred programming editor installed. We will install all other tools required during the workshop.
