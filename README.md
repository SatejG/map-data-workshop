## Prerequisites

This is a hands-on workshop to learn how to create map-based data analysis and visualization applications. JavaScript knowledge is required, and server-side JavaScript knowledge is preferred, as most of the coding will be server-side using `nodejs`.

Every participant should have a laptop with `nodejs` and a preferred programming editor installed. We will install all other tools required during the workshop.
