# map-data-workshop

## Objectives

This workshop will provide an overview of the current state of mapping technologies, teach the basics of data collection, management, and dissemination including building databases, APIs, and applications for education and citizen science. Additionally, by fully understanding what makes today's applications do their magic, the attendees will also learn about the legal hurdles that have to be overcome to access and reuse data, and the steps they can take to minimize or eliminate such hurdles.

## Learner Level

This is an intermediate-to-advanced workshop. It will introduce and take you through advanced concepts in data acquisition, management and use, and also legal aspects (open source vs. proprietary). Call it *intermediate* or *advanced*, it certainly is not a *beginner* workshop. *All* users will be required to have their own laptops and familiarity with Unix-style commands, console, and JavaScript. We don't want to classify the workshop as *advanced* because the apps you will build will not be suitable for launching a company and becoming a millionaire. However, you will certainly learn enough to build your own apps for **education** and **citizen science** purposes.

## Goal

Our goal is to not just teach you about the technology but also the associated legal issues, and in that process, hopefully help you appreciate why being open and collaborating with others is very important when working on the web.

## Duration

The full workshop will last five days, with the structure as shown below:

## Prerequisites

This is a hands-on workshop to learn how to create map-based data analysis and visualization applications. JavaScript knowledge is required, and server-side JavaScript knowledge is preferred, as most of the coding will be server-side using [nodejs](http://nodejs.org). Participants should be comfortable with Unix-style command line environment, console, and also know HTML and CSS.

Every participant should have a laptop with `nodejs` and `npm` as well as a preferred programming editor installed. We will install all other tools required during the workshop.

**Note:** If you have a Mac laptop, please ensure that you have Xcode installed.
